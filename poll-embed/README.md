## How to embed Streamlit apps in Medium - this article records the changes that had to be made to an app in order to embed it in a Medium article

## The app is based on 'Visualizing 'Brexit Regret' and the files for the app are detailed below.

A recent poll shows that more Britons favour rejoining the EU than those who still support Brexit. Let's build an app and draw someÂ graphs.

This README should be read in conjunction with the Medium article linked to above

This is a Streamlit app that you can find online [here](https://alanjones2-alan-jones-article-code-pollapp1-vgotws.streamlit.app/). It comprises of a main program and four library files:

_app2.py_ - the main program

_overall.py_ - the coding for drawing graphs of the overall result

_regions.py_ - the coding for the choropleths


_tables.py_ - displays the raw data


The data files used are overall.csv, regions.csv and age.csv

_UK_regions_geojson_ defines GB the regions

The xlst files are the original polling data.
