This is a Streamlit app that you can find online [here](https://alanjones2-alan-jones-article-code-poll-embedapp2-wzmqpq.streamlit.app//). It comprises of a main program and four library files:

_app2.py_ - the main program (this is a modified version of app1.py - mainly reduction of sizes of stuff in order to make it embeddable)

_overall.py_ - the coding for drawing graphs of the overall result

_regions.py_ - the coding for the choropleths


_tables.py_ - displays the raw data


The data files used are overall.csv, regions.csv and age.csv

_UK_regions_geojson_ defines GB the regions

The xlst files are the original polling data.
