## [Web Visualization with Plotly and Flask](https://towardsdatascience.com/web-visualization-with-plotly-and-flask-3660abf9c946)

Why use Dash when Plotly plus Flask is easy and more flexible? In the first of two articles I compare a simple Dash app with a similar one constructed from Falsk and HTML. I conclude that my version is easier and more flexible than Dash.
