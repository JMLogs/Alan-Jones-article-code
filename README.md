## [Web Visualization with Plotly and Flask](https://towardsdatascience.com/web-visualization-with-plotly-and-flask-3660abf9c946)

Why use Dash when Plotly plus Flask is easy and more flexible? In the first of two articles I compare a simple Dash app with a similar one constructed from Falsk and HTML. I conclude that my version is easier and more flexible than Dash.

[Sample code here](https://github.com/alanjones2/Flask-Plotly)

Whether you are sharing your Jupyter Notebooks with friends and colleagues or publishing them more widely, 
they will be better appreciated if they are well laid out and formatted - Medium article.

## [Python Pandas and SQLite](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-pandas-and-sqlite-a0e2c052456f)

Using SQLite to store your Pandas dataframes gives you a persistent store and a way of easily selecting and filtering your data
