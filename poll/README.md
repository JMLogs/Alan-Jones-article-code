This is a Streamlit app that you can find online [here](https://alanjones2-alan-jones-article-code-pollapp1-vgotws.streamlit.app/). It comprises of a main program and four library files:

_app1.py_ - the main program

_overall.py_ - the coding for drawing graphs of the overall result

_regions.py_ - the coding for the choropleths


_tables.py_ - displays the raw data


The data files used are overall.csv, regions.csv and age.csv

_UK_regions_geojson_ defines GB the regions

The xlst files are the original polling data.
