# 3 Ways to Create a Multi-Page Streamlit App

There are two aspects to creating mutipage apps: how to select then from the user interface and how to select the code to run the apps.

The UI could be option menu, drop down, buttons, etc.

I concentrate on the more technical aspect how to select the code:

 - use a select statement such as `if else` or 3.10 pattern matching
 - structure apps as a library 
 - make a generic launcher app for a library of apps
