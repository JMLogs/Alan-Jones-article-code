# [SQL, Pandas or Both - Analysing the UK Electoral System](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/sql-pandas-or-both-analysing-the-uk-electoral-system-24fa01d33d05)

## Pandas is great for analysing and plotting data but should you store your data in a database and select it with SQL. Let's take a look at some common operations using Pandas and SQL and see how they compare.


There are two main sources of the code one for the SQL code and the other for the Pandas equivalent. They are:

- sqlpandasdb.ipynb
- sqlpandaspd.ipynb

To create the data that is used in the article and code I used _createsqlpandas.py_

The original data is in _original_elections.csv_ and the newly creted data are in _elections.db_ and _elections.csv_.
